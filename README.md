# Alexander-Code-Portfoilo
A portfolio of various bits of code by Alexander Sundland (me).

## Game Engine
Code from a class I did on creating a Game Engine together with a classmate.  
Runs OpenGL to render graphics in Qt, and calculates the physics of a ball object falling onto and rolling off some geometry.  
We focused on trying to decouple our various game components into separate classes that don't touch each other more than they need to for this.  
We also played around with Lua scripting a bit.  
Some of the more important classes included here.  

## Blargon Jargon
Some code from my bachelor project, Blargon Jargon, which can be played here: https://salamandridae.itch.io/blargon-jargon  
We primarily used Unreal Engine's "blueprints" GUI to create this game, but the included class contains the core gameplay loop functionality.  

## AoC
Small assortment of old "Advent of Code" challenges.
